# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
The program applies the discount only if it is **20% or higher**; otherwise, it keeps the original price.

## Features
- Function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` to apply the discount logic.
- User input for original price and discount percentage.
- Prints the final price after applying the discount or the original price if no discount applies.

## Example Usage
```bash
Enter the original price: 500
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied! The final price is: 375.0
